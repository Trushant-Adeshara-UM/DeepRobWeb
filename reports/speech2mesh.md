## Abstract

With the rise of additive manufacturing, the ability to produce everyday objects on-demand and in-house has become a reality. However, this technology often requires specific prior knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users. To address this challenge, we introduce Speech2Mesh, an innovative approach that transforms verbal prompts from users into printable 3D meshes. This method simplifies the process of 3D printing, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

## Results

Visual results are great for project webpages; exciting results can captivate an audience and convey dense information efficiently. We suggest including images, figures, animations, and videos on your webpage. For example, static images can be displayed as shown below:
